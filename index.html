        I will show you how to advance your career as a web developer, from
        using the most fancy tools to learning the most in-demand skills. Some
        technologies that maybe aren't as popular today will be tomorrow's most
        sought-after skills, and some that were popular yesterday are already
        outdated. It will depend on the market and the needs of the
        companies/region you are targeting, you should focus on learning one or
        another technology. I will help you to make the right decisions to
        advance your career as a web developer.
